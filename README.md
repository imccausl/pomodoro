# A Pomodoro Timer
---
This is a work in progress (as you'll no doubt be able to tell) which I am using to practice Functional programming in JavaScript and writing clean, understandable, modular, reusable code.

The project is conceived of as consisting of:


*Pomodoro.js* : the module that generates the timer model.
*Tasks.js* : the module that generates the tasks model. (This pomodoro timer is going to allow you to set task-specific timers and organize them in a todo list.)

*Notify.js* : a pub/sub module that sends out events when the model is changed.

And then the View/ViewModel stuff which I'm going to write last and haven't fully fleshed out yet.
